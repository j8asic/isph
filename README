REPO IS HERE FOR LEARNING PURPOSES
==================================

    This is an abandoned project. 
    It was started long ago, just when OpenCL came out.
    It has some nice ideas, e.g. OpenCL semantics.


Project ISPH
============

    Cross-platform CFD library for mesh-free simulation and 
    visualization of incompressible flows using Smoothed Particle 
    Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods.

    Check out http://isph.sourceforge.net/ for more, and up to date infos.


Project Structure
----------------

    /isph
        /bin        compiled tools
        /build      build and IDE project files
        /data       test and other data
        /doc        library (doxygen) and tools documentation
        /isphlib    library sources
        /lib        compiled library files
        /tools      tools sources


Requirements
------------

    For successful compilation you'll need the following installed on
    your system:

    - OpenCL SDK 1.0 or later

    Since there is no integrated visualization engine at the moment,
    we suggest you post-process simulated data with:

    - ParaView (don't forget to enable meshless plugin)
    - VisIt
    - Tecplot
    - etc.


Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

    - Linux 2.6
    - Windows XP, Vista, 7

    Other operating systems may work but are not tested.
    Soon it will be tested on Mac OS X as well.


Supported Compilers
-------------------

    - MSVC 9 and newer
    - GCC 4.0 and newer

    Other standard C++ compilers should work but are not tested.


Compiling the project
---------------------

    - Windows

        using Visual Studio 2010 open the solution that is
        located in /build/vs2010, and build the solution

    - Linux

        In main project folder type:

        make            to build both library and tools
        make isphlib    to only build the library
        make tools      to only build tools
        make clean      to clean built stuff
